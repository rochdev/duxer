The missing react/redux framework.

The goal of this project is to provide a framework for building, testing and bootstrapping React/Redux applications so
you can focus on coding instead of spending hours (or days) creating your own build process or customizing a starter
kit.

## Requirements

* node `^4.2.0`
* npm `^3.0.0`

## Features

* CSS modules
* SASS/SCSS
* PostCSS
* Babel compilation (with `es2015`, `react` and `stage-0` presets built-in)
* Unit testing using Mocha
* Lightweight Koa server
* Hot module reloading

## Coming soon

* Configuration file
* Universal application support
* Flow support
* Linting
* Redux store with support for lazy loading reducers
* Asynchronous route loading
* Code generation
* Command-line interface

## Credits

This project is based on the excellent [React Redux Starter Kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit)
